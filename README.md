# Mechanistic Interpretability Implementation Project (Language Specific Neurons)
This repository contains the dependency files from conducting experiments using the implementations of the paper [Language-Specific Neurons: The Key to Multilingual Capabilities in Large Language Models
](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16438) in ACL 2024. [Link to the original GitHub repository](https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Language-Specific-Neurons?tab=readme-ov-file)
