        "output": "The answer to this question is not simple and there are many different theories’s that have been proposed to explain why some people enjoy being scared and others don’t. One theory suggests that those who enjoy being scared may be more likely to experience a rush of adrenaline which can lead to feelings of excitement and pleasure. On the other hand, those who avoid being scared may be more sensitive to fear and anxiety which can make them feel uncomfortable or even panicked.

        "output": "The Black death was a pandemic that killed millions of people across Europe and Asia. It is believed to have been caused by the bubonic plague, which is spread through contact with infected fleas-carrying rats. The black death was one of the most devastating events in human history. It changed everything from how we live our lives to what we eat and drink. In this blog post I will discuss some of these changes including how it affected food production and trade routes between countries as well as how it impacted religion during this time period.\nThe Black death was an epidemic that swept through Europe in the 1300s. It killed millions of people and left many more sick or injured. The disease was caused by a bacteria called Yersinia pestis, which can be found on rodents feces and flea bites wounds sites. This bacterium enters your body when you come into contact with contaminated objects such as clothing or bedding material that has been exposed to infected person’s blood or saliva droplets from coughing sneezing vomiting etcetera (CDc).\nThe symptoms of yersinia pestis include fever chills headache mus pain diarrhea vomiting abdominal pain joint pain back pain neck pain stiffness weakness fatigue confusion dizziness loss appetite weight loss nausea vomiting bloody stools dark urine pale skin yellow eyes red tongue swollen lymph nodes enlargement of liver spleen kidney heart failure respiratory distress shock coma death within days after exposure (cdc).\nThe black death was a terrible event for everyone involved but especially those who were unlucky enough to contract it themselves!\nWhat if the black death never happened?\nIf the black death never happened then there would be no need for quarantine because there wouldn’t be any dise outbreaks like typhoid fever or smallpox anymore either so people could travel freely without worry about getting sick while they are away from home .\nHow did the black death affect society?\nThe black death was a major event in European history.

        "output": "Jazz is an American musical art form that originated in African-American communities at the beginning of 20th century. It combines elements from European classical music, blues, ragtime, and other forms of folk music. The word “jazz” was first used to describe this new style of music by a critic named James Herman Johnson in 1917.\nJazz has been around since then but it wasn’t until after World war II when it became popular among white Americans audiences because they were looking for something different than what they had before which led them towards jazz music as well as other types of music such as rock n roll etcetera…\nThe history of jazz can be traced back to the early  1800s when slaves owners would hire musicians to play on their plantations or farmhouse during harvest season so they could work longer hours without having any distractions from their daily routine (which included eating dinner).
